Nora is a simple rendering engine for 2D and 3D applications, using OpenGL and GLFW.
It is targeted for desktop PCs and browsers (WebGL).

Nora is not intended to be a fully-fledged game engine.

It is designed to be a minimalistic framework/library for quickly getting something to the screen,
while maintaining low-level access to OpenGL functionality.

Nore is still under development and tries to mainly cover my own use-cases (at least for now).
